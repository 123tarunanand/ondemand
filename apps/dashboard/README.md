# OOD Dashboard

This app is a Rails app for Open OnDemand that serves as a gateway to launching
other Open OnDemand apps. It is meant to be run as the user (and on behalf of
the user) using the app. Thus, at an HPC center if I log into OnDemand using
the `efranz` account, this app should run as `efranz`. This Rails app doesn't
use a database.

### Disk Quota Warnings

We currently support displaying warnings to users on the Dashboard if their
disk quota is nearing its limit. This requires an auto-updated (it is
recommended to update this file every **5 minutes** with a cronjob) JSON file
that lists all user quotas. The JSON schema for version `1` is given as:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "timestamp": 1525361263,
  "quotas": [
    {
      ...
    },
    {
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

Where `version` defines the version of the JSON schema used, `timestamp`
defines when this file was generated, and `quotas` is a list of quota objects
(see below).

You can configure the Dashboard to use this JSON file (or files) by setting the
environment variable `OOD_QUOTA_PATH` as a colon-delimited list of all JSON
file paths.

The default threshold for displaying the warning is at 95% (`0.95`), but this
can be changed with the environment variable `OOD_QUOTA_THRESHOLD`.

An example is given as:

```shell
# /etc/ood/config/apps/dashboard/env

OOD_QUOTA_PATH="/path/to/quota1.json:/path/to/quota2.json"
OOD_QUOTA_THRESHOLD="0.80"
```

#### Individual User Quota

If the quota is defined as a `user` quota, then it applies to only disk
resources used by the user alone. This is the default type of quota object and
is given in the following format:

```json
{
  "path": "/path/to/volume1",
  "user": "user1",
  "total_block_usage": 1000,
  "block_limit": 2000,
  "total_file_usage": 5,
  "file_limit": 10
}
```

*Warning: A block must be equal to 1 KB for proper conversions.*

#### Individual Fileset Quota

If the quota is defined as a `fileset` quota, then it applies to all disk
resources used underneath a given volume. This requires the object to be
repeated for **each user** that uses disk resources under this given volume.
The format is given as:

```json
{
  "type": "fileset",
  "user": "user1",
  "path": "/path/to/volume2",
  "block_usage": 500,
  "total_block_usage": 1000,
  "block_limit": 2000,
  "file_usage": 1,
  "total_file_usage": 5,
  "file_limit": 10
}
```

Where `block_usage` and `file_usage` are the disk resource usages attributed to
the specified user only.

*Note: For each user with resources under this fileset, the above object will
be repeated with just `user`, `block_usage`, and `file_usage` changing.*

*Warning: A block must be equal to 1 KB for proper conversions.*

### Balance Warnings

We currently support displaying warnings to users on the Dashboard if their
balance is nearing its limit. This requires an auto-updated (it is
recommended to update this file every day with a cronjob) JSON file
that lists all user balances. The JSON schema for version `1` is given as:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "timestamp": 1525361263,
  "config": {
    "unit": "RU",
    "project_type": "project"
  },
  "balances": [
    {
      ...
    },
    {
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

Where `version` defines the version of the JSON schema used, `timestamp`
defines when this file was generated, and `balances` is a list of balance objects
(see below).

The value for `config.unit` defines the type of units for balances and `config.project_type` would be project, account, or group, etc. Both values are used in locales and can be any string value.

You can configure the Dashboard to use this JSON file (or files) by setting the
environment variable `OOD_BALANCE_PATH` as a colon-delimited list of all JSON
file paths.

The default threshold for displaying the warning is at `0`, but this
can be changed with the environment variable `OOD_BALANCE_THRESHOLD`.

An example is given as:

```shell
# /etc/ood/config/apps/dashboard/env

OOD_BALANCE_PATH="/path/to/balance1.json:/path/to/balance2.json"
OOD_BALANCE_THRESHOLD=1000
```

#### User Balance

If the balance is defined as a `user` quota, then it applies to only that user. Omit the `project` key:

```json
{
  "user": "user1",
  "value": 10
}
```

#### Project Balance

If the balance is defined as a `project` balance, then it applies to a project/account/group, whatever is defined for `config.project_type`:

```json
{
  "user": "user1",
  "project": "project1",
  "value": 10
}
```

## Development

### Building noVNC with OnDemand custom changes

For this example we will assume that you have `rsync` and `hub` installed in your development environment.

Node version used: `v12.16.1`

Open OnDemand includes modifications to noVNC that enable users to manually set the compression and image quality for their noVNC session

```sh
# Go to /tmp
cd /tmp

# Clone OnDemand
hub clone OSC/ondemand

# Change to OnDemand directory
cd /tmp/ondemand

# Checkout specific commit with noVNC 1.1.0 and our changes applied
hub checkout 0d70e4d88d2d1c6ccac6dd587ece9d141039c1cc
```

Make changes as needed to the noVNC core and then we will compile the app.js file that OnDemand uses

```sh
# Go to /tmp
cd /tmp

# Clone noVNC 1.1.0
hub clone noVNC/noVNC

# Switch to official 1.1.0 release branch
hub checkout 9fe2fd04d4eeda0d5a360009453861803ba0ca84

# Copy /utils into your OnDemand noVNC code, do not add any forward slashes to any folder paths here.
rsync -rh /tmp/noVNC/utils /tmp/ondemand/apps/dashboard/public/noVNC-1.1.0

# Now switch back to your OnDemand noVNC directory
cd /tmp/ondemand/apps/dashboard/public/noVNC-1.1.0

# Run npm install
npm install
```

We have installed all of the dependencies that we need to build noVNC 1.1.0 now. After making your changes to the noVNC core, run the following commands to compile and clean up your build:

```sh
# Make sure you're in the right directory
cd /tmp/ondemand/apps/dashboard/public/noVNC-1.1.0

# Compile noVNC 1.1.0, don't forget to use the command flags in this example. This command will output the compiled files in /build in the same directory
./utils/use_require.js --as commonjs --with-app

# Recursively copy folders from the /build folder into /tmp/ondemand/apps/dashboard/public/noVNC-1.1.0
rsync -rh build/ /tmp/ondemand/apps/dashboard/public/noVNC-1.1.0

# Clean up development files used for building
rm -rf node_modules/ build/ utils/
```

Finally we need to update `vnc.html` to include the third party library used for legacy browser support for URI parameters.

```sh
# Open /tmp/ondemand/apps/dashboard/public/noVNC-1.1.0/public/vnc.html
sublime /tmp/ondemand/apps/dashboard/public/noVNC-1.1.0/vnc.html

# Add the following to vnc.html before any noVNC scripts are loaded
<script nomodule src="shims/url-search-params@0.1.2.min.js"></script>
```

Congratulations, you have successfully rebuilt noVNC 1.1.0 with the Open OnDemand custom changes included!

### Updating noVNC

To update noVNC you need to first download and unzip the latest stable Node.js.
You can find the latest downloads here:

https://nodejs.org/en/download/

For our demonstration purposes I will use Node.js v6.11.1:

```sh
# Go to my home directory
cd ${HOME}

# Get latest stable node.js
wget https://nodejs.org/dist/v6.11.1/node-v6.11.1-linux-x64.tar.xz

# Unzip it
tar xf node-v6.11.1-linux-x64.tar.xz
```

Next we download and build noVNC:

```sh
# Go to my home directory
cd ${HOME}

# Download the commit of noVNC we are interested in
wget https://github.com/novnc/noVNC/archive/9fe2fd04d4eeda0d5a360009453861803ba0ca84.zip

# Unzip it
unzip 9fe2fd04d4eeda0d5a360009453861803ba0ca84.zip

# Go into the noVNC directory
cd noVNC-9fe2fd04d4eeda0d5a360009453861803ba0ca84/

# Install the dependency packages
PATH=${HOME}/node-v6.11.1-linux-x64/bin:$PATH npm install

# Build the noVNC libraries
PATH=${HOME}/node-v6.11.1-linux-x64/bin:$PATH utils/use_require.js --as commonjs --with-app
```

Now we copy the build to our Dashboard code under the `public/` root with an
appropriately named directory (typically a shortened-form of the SHA commit):

```sh
cp -r build ${HOME}/ondemand/dev/ood-dashboard/public/noVNC-9fe2fd0
```

Finally we need to update the Dashboard code to use this new version of noVNC.
We edit this file under the Dashboard code:

```
app/helpers/batch_connect/sessions_helper.rb
```

And modify `BatchConnect::SessionsHelper#novnc_link` with the new version.


### Running the system tests

The Rails system tests are currently using the Rails default: capybara + selenium headless chrome. These tests are not meant to be a replacement for
actual end to end acceptance tests, which we may also use selenium to write (though via waitr and waitr-rails).

To run the tests, do the following:

1. Install the chromedriver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/ and https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=87.0.4280.88/
2. Add the downloaded chromedriver binary to your path
3. Run `bin/rake test:system`

There are some possible issues when switching from headless chrome to chrome, which lets you watch the browser be driven as the tests
are run that may have been fixed in Rails 6. Also, while failed tests auto-generate a screenshot, we might want to also extend that to
print out any javascript errors. You can get an array of these errors by doing:

    messages = page.driver.browser.manage.logs.get(:browser)

These errors reference files and line numbers. Unfortunately, it isn't clear to me yet how to access those files to print the corresopnding lines which would also be useful.

We may consider switching to waitr and waitr-rails.
